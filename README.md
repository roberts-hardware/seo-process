## What This Does

Most people know what to do for SEO. Nobody does it consistently.

This agent does:

1. **Discovers** keyword opportunities from your actual Google Search Console data
2. **Writes** psychology-driven content in your brand voice (not generic AI slop)
3. **Builds links** through competitor mining, unlinked mentions, and broken link outreach
4. **Monitors** rankings weekly and flags what's climbing or dropping
5. **Checks health** with PageSpeed audits, crawl checks, and image optimization
6. **Repeats** automatically, getting smarter about your brand every week

The loop is the point. Each cycle feeds the next one.

## The Four Skills

### skills/seo-agent — Discovery + Monitoring

The brain that finds opportunities and tracks progress.

| Script | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `seo-discover.sh` | Finds strike zone keywords (positions 5-20) from GSC + DataForSEO |
| `seo-monitor.sh` | Weekly ranking snapshots, flags climbers and droppers |
| `seo-compete.sh` | Competitor gap analysis: keywords they rank for that you don't |

### skills/seo-forge — Content Engine

The writer that sounds like you, not like ChatGPT.

| Script | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `seo-interview.sh` | 8 questions that build your brand voice and positioning |
| `seo-research.sh` | SERP analysis, People Also Ask, search intent classification |
| `seo-check.sh` | Validates your GSC and DataForSEO connections |

**What makes it different:** Interview mode learns your voice. Weekly refinement keeps it current. Psychology frameworks make content convert, not just rank. Anti-AI-Overview strategy bakes in real experience markers.

### skills/seo-links — Backlink Acquisition

Content without links is a prayer. This skill finds link opportunities.

| Script | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `link-mine.sh` | Mines competitor backlink profiles for targets |
| `link-mentions.sh` | Finds unlinked brand mentions (easiest links to get) |
| `link-broken.sh` | Finds broken links on resource pages, pitches your content |
| `link-internal.sh` | Audits internal linking, finds orphan pages |
| `link-prospect.sh` | Finds "best tools" and resource pages to get listed on |

### skills/seo-health — Technical SEO Monitoring

Rankings depend on a solid technical foundation.

| Script | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `health-speed.sh` | PageSpeed + Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) |
| `health-crawl.sh` | Broken links, missing meta tags, redirect chains, mixed content |
| `health-images.sh` | Oversized images, missing alt text, wrong formats |

### skills/seo-checklist — Reference

Technical SEO reference covering meta tags, schema markup (Article, FAQ, HowTo), llms.txt, topical authority (hub-and-spoke), and Core Web Vitals thresholds.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and running
- Google Search Console access for your site
- (Optional) [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com) API account (~$50/month)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMattBerman/seo-kit.git

```

### 4. Let the agent interview you

Tell your OpenClaw agent: *"Run the SEO Forge brand interview"*

8 questions. 5 minutes. Every article after this sounds like you.

### 5. Set it on a schedule

```
Monday:    seo-discover + seo-monitor + health checks
Tuesday:   Write content targeting top opportunities
Wednesday: link-internal (add cross-links to new content)
Thursday:  link-mine + link-mentions (find backlink targets)
Friday:    seo-compete on one competitor + link-prospect
```
